# How to Implement Network Simulation in JMeter

# Introduction
This template will help you to explain How to Implement Network Simulation in JMeter. JMeter is the most popular performance testing tool so in this template we will see How JMeter helps us to implement network simulation.

# Technologies Used
Performance Testing Tool - Apache JMeter 
JAVA is prerequisite for Apache JMeter so make sure that java should be installed.

## Steps for Execution

1. Clone the repository on your local system

2. Once you clone the repository, You will get two files

	a) jmeter.properties
	b) blazedemo.jmx
	
3. Replace jmeter.properties inside bin folder (In JMeter) with existing jmeter.properties file and also put blazedemo.jmx inside bin folder (In JMeter)

4. We have provide 6400kbps cps value in jmeter.properties, you can provide as per the requirement

5. Start JMeter and open blazedemo.jmx

6. To run the test click the green play button on toolbar.

7. Now we can see the test result on different listeners under the Thread Group.
